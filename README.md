# Power-Bi-project
Nameste! In this Power BI project, we analyze E-commerce sales data using two CSV files: **Orders** and **Details**."
The "Orders" file contains essential information about Orders given by the user and its values. Meanwhile, the "Details" file provides
item-specific data about the product and other details that are provided for the customer. By combining and visualizing these datasets,
the Power BI project aims to offer comprehensive insights into E-commerce sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance for 
informed decision-making.This will be benifitial for the E-commerce owner.
